fakepop is a fake pop3 daemon. It returns always the same messages to
all users, it does not care about usernames and passwords. All
user/pass combinations are accepted.

The main purpose of fakepop is to advice users that your server only
accepts pop3-ssl and they have wrongly configured pop3 without
ssl. You can customize messages in /etc/fakepop/ directory to teach
your users how they should configure their mail clients to use
pop3-ssl instead of pop3.
