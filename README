FAKEPOP

fakepop is a fake pop3 daemon. It returns always the same messages to
all users, it does not care about usernames and passwords. All
user/pass combinations are accepted.

It is currently run from an inetd-style service daemon.  Choose
openbsd-inetd or xinetd or the flavour of your choice.

The main purpose of fakepop is to advise users that your server only
accepts pop3-ssl and they have wrongly configured pop3 without
ssl. You can customize messages in /etc/fakepop/ directory to teach
your users how they should configure their mail clients to use
pop3-ssl instead of pop3.

You can put all the messages you want to deliver to the users that
connect at fakepop in /etc/fakepop/ for more information see
/usr/fakepop/readme.config


CONFIGURATION

To configure fakepop, put all messages that you want fakepop
to deliver in the /etc/fakepop/ directory.  Zero messages is allowed.

Some filenames are not considered as messages:
  - filenames begining with '.' (hidden files)
  - filenames begining with 'readme' (case insensitive)
  - filenames ending in '~' (backup files)

Check message examples at README.example*

Assure that files under /etc/fakepop can be read by the user that runs
fakepop (usually nobody)
