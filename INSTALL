--- Instructions ---

Easy way: if you use Debian, just install package "fakepop" :-)


fakepop runs with inetd, xinetd or other superdaemon tools.
Instructions come with inetd configuration. Please adapt to other
superdaemon if you do not use inetd.

(as a regular user)
    make
(as root)
    make install DESTDIR=/

add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf
pop-3 stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/in.fakepop

remember to restart inetd

configuration instructions are in /etc/fakepop/README
